## 3. Background Presentation

**Presenter:** Luigi Asprino  

**Summary:**
- **Origins:** Facade-X originated from the EU *SPICE* project (2020) on cultural heritage data integration.  
- **Motivation:** To solve integration challenges across heterogeneous data formats (JSON, CSV, XML, SQL, etc.).  
- **Approach:** Create *data facades* â€” homogeneous RDF views of diverse data sources, enabling SPARQL querying.  

**Key Achievements:**
- *2021:* Introduced data facade concept at Semantics Conference.  
- *2023:* ACM Transactions on Internet Technology paper formalizing the method for general data formats.  
- Developed the **SPARQL Anything** open-source tool.  

**Community Group Goals:**
1. Standardize the **data-facade approach** and meta-model.  
2. Define **mappings** for different data formats.  
3. Specify **SPARQL dialect** for faÃ§ade access.  
4. Build a collaborative and interoperable community ecosystem.

## 4. Discussion Summary

### 4.1 Specification & Meta-Model
- First priority: develop a **Facade-X specification** describing the meta-model.  
- Possibly use **RDF and SHACL** for formal definitions.  
- Establish ontology for describing properties and classes extracted from the source.  
- Ensure alignment with existing W3C standards (RDF, SHACL, RML).  

---

### 4.2 Mappings and Profiles
- Define mappings from various data formats (CSV, JSON, XML, etc.) to the Facade-X model.  
---

### 4.3 SPARQL Integration
- Current practice: use of `SERVICE` clauses with custom parameters.  
- Goal: maintain full **SPARQL compatibility** without changing syntax.  
- Explore standardized parameter passing (possibly via HTTP requests).  
- Potential collaboration with W3C RDF/SPARQL Working Groups.  
---

### 4.4 Collaboration Infrastructure
- **GitHub** chosen as the main collaboration platform.  
- Specifications will use **ReSpec** for W3C-style publishing.  
- A **GitHub Pages** website will follow once specs are ready.

## 5. Next Meetings
- **Frequency:** Monthly (recorded; minutes circulated).  
- **Next meeting:** **Monday, 1 December 2025** (rescheduled from 24 Nov due to Thanksgiving).  
- **Focus:**  
  - Begin drafting the meta-model.  
  - Member use-case presentations (**Ryan Shaw** volunteered).  

---

## 6. Closing Remarks
- Chairs thanked participants for their contributions and enthusiasm.  
- Emphasis on collaboration, open standardization, and community growth.
